# Programming Language "Bella" Interpeter
An interpreter for a programming language called "Bella", written in TypeScript. Bella is a friendly, simple language, relatively easy to implement.
* The language is limited to numbers, assignments, conditionals, loops, and simple functions. 
* Variables can only hold numbers, not functions.
* Function “bodies” are limited to simple expressions (like Python lambdas), so we don’t have to deal with any scoping complications like temporal dead zones. 
* Scoping is as in Python: local variables and parameters are function-scoped, and shadowing is allowed.
